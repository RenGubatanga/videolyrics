                Lock me up and throw away the key
                He knows how to get the best out of me
                I'm no force for the world to see
                Trade my whole life just to be

                Tell nobody I control you
                I broke you just to own you
                They can't tell that I love you
                'Cause you're loyal, baby

                I love when you're submissive
                Love it when I break skin
                You feel pain without flinchin'
                So say it

                Give me tough love
                Leave me with nothin' when I come down
                My kinda love
                Push me and choke me 'til I pass out

                We don't gotta be in love, no
                I don't gotta be the one, no
                I just wanna be one of your girls tonight
                We don't gotta be in love, no
                I don't gotta be the one, no
                I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh

                Push me down, hold me down
                Spit in my mouth while you turn me on
                I wanna take your light inside
                Dim me down, snuff me out
                Hands on my neck while you push it out
                And I'm screamin' out

                Give me tough love
                Leave me with nothin' when I come down
                My kinda love
                Force me and choke me 'til I pass out

                We don't gotta be in love, no
                I don't gotta be the one, no
                I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (tonight)
                We don't gotta be in love, no
                I don't gotta be the one, no (oh)
                I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh

                Lock me up and throw away the key
                He knows how to get the best out of me
                I'm no force for the world to see
                Trade my whole life just to be

                Top of the world but I'm still not free
                It's such a secret that I keep
                Until it's gone, I can never find peace
                Brace my whole life just to be

                We don't gotta be in love, no
                I don't gotta be the one, no
                I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (tonight)
                We don't gotta be in love, no
                I don't gotta be the one, no (oh)
                I just wann–∞ be one of your girls tonight, oh (oh)
